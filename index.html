        <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2> 
        <p>My name is Matt Verdillo and I have worked in the IT consulting/staffing industry for close to 5 years. I come from the business side but have formed great relationships with some Software Engineers in Nashville and have developed a passion for this work. I'm more than excited to learn, develop, and create.<br />
            I'm a native of Richmond, VA. and relocated to Nashville, TN. in 2016 for an opportunity with my company as Nashville continued to experience and economic and technological surge. I'm passionate about the Earth and sustainability, gardening, my two dogs Max and Roo (Max pixture here), and learning and growing as an individual.
